#### <b>Next steps</b>

Use the course as a resource and reference, it's not a one-time watch and forget about it thing.

Dive into examples and dummy projects, for instance clone simplified versions of popular applications.

Build a portfolio and dive deeper into JavaScript and (browser) APIs, for instance build a PWA, on-the-edge-API, SPA

Never stop learning and growing!
