## Section 31: Introduction to testing

## Day 64 - 2022-06-12

#### <b>What is testing? Why does it matter?</b>

Instructors understanding of testing: There is some code, there is some expected result, and testing is what we do to check we get that expected result.

Right. Nothing about learning about and getting to know the software and understanding how it actually works and communicating that back to stakeholders. Ok.

No further comments, your honor.
