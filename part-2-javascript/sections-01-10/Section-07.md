## Section 7: Working with the DOM

## Day 48 - 2022-05-27

#### <b>Working with the DOM</b>

Worked extensively with this in the web dev course (obviously) so don't expect to take many notes here. Will add new ideas for understanding issues or new details when I encounter them.

I actually ended up skipping through most of this as it was known from before and I don't need most if it now anyway. I'll return to it later if it should become more relevant.

A [thorough guide to the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) on MDN.
