## Section 37: Course summary and where to go next

## Day 42 - 2022-05-21

### Going through course content for day 100:

#### <b>Bonus possible next steps, practice opportunities and project ideas</b>

So I finished the course, now what? More courses on [Academind](https://academind.com/courses) or suggestions for [next steps](https://100daysofwebdevelopment.com/next-steps)

Personally I want to learn more about JavaScript for developing Node applications, and also learning more about Vue. I will definately also have to revisit a lot of stuff, perhaps in particular CSS.
