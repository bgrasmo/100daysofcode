# Part 1: 100 days of code - 2022 Web Development Bootcamp

Started the 100 days journey by going through [100 days of code - 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code-web-development-bootcamp/) course on Udemy by [Academind](https://www.udemy.com/user/academind/)

These are my notes as I go along the course and is currently the first draft. In case I have to look up these notes and find they aren't actually helpful for me, I might update the content. But right now, first draft and they are what they are. They might not even be correct as I might have misunderstood the instructor.

The code I write during the course will be in the code-playground folder. At the start I tried using new branches for each day but that didn't really work, so I ended up with a folder per section, though named after the course days they covered. The early code is still in separate branches as mentioned in their notes sections, I will add them as folders later.

The notes for each section are in their respective files, links to them below. The plan is to have a short summary of each section here, but that will come later.

I finished the course a little quicker than planned, so will continue with more on JavaScript and Vue for the remaining days.
