# My 100 days of code journey notes

Going through [100 days of code - 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code-web-development-bootcamp/) course on Udemy by [Academind](https://www.udemy.com/user/academind/)

These are my notes as I go along the course and is currently the first draft. In case I have to look up these notes and find they aren't actually helpful for me, I might update the content. But right now, first draft and they are what they are. They might not even be correct as I might have misunderstood the instructor.

The code I write during the course will be in the code-playground folder, but they will be for the last day in this document as I will update it as I go along. The plan is to create branches to easily be able to go back and look at code for a given lecture.

I've moved my notes to seperate files, one for each section of the course, as this file got a bit big and unwieldy. The plan is to add links to the individial sections from here, with a short summary of what they are about.
